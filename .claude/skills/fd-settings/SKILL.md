# /fd-settings — edit Profile settings

Conversational, not menu-driven. You read the current Profile, present it grouped into sections, ask what to change, then apply the changes.

## Step 1 — Read current Profile

```bash
python3 -c "from state.profile import read; import json; p = read(); print(json.dumps({k: v for k, v in p.__dict__.items() if k not in ('page_id', 'profile_hash')}, indent=2, default=str))"
```

Display the result to the user, grouped into the three sections below. Use plain text, not JSON.

### Section A — Search preferences

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `variant` | `EU` or `US` — controls VC roster + region filters |
| `eu_include_uk_ie` | (EU only) include UK/Ireland-tagged jobs |
| `home_country`, `home_state`, `home_city` | for residency filtering at scorer stage |
| `work_modes` | subset of `["Remote", "Hybrid", "Onsite (includes Hybrid)"]` |
| `search_outside_home` | if True, allow remote-from-elsewhere postings |
| `willing_to_relocate` | if True, country-mismatch residency requirements don't penalize |
| `accepted_seniority` | subset of `["entry", "mid", "senior", "staff", "principal", "executive"]` |
| `salary_floor_amount` + `salary_floor_currency` | annual floor (USD/EUR/GBP); jobs disclosing below this are dropped at S9 prefilter |
| `interest_description` | free text — what kind of role excites you |
| `pursue_blockers` | free text — disqualifying patterns (e.g. "defense, gambling") |
| `stretch_indicators` | free text — partial-fit signals (e.g. "early-stage, equity-heavy") |
| `cv_url`, `cv_summary` | self-explanatory; cv_summary is what scorer sees |
| `excluded_companies`, `excluded_industries` | multi-select blacklists |

### Section B — System settings

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `posted_since_window` | `1 week` / `2 weeks` / `1 month` |
| `ai50_seed_enabled` | enable the 14-company AI-50 supplement (Cohere, Cognition, etc.) |
| `webhook_url`, `webhook_enabled`, `webhook_notify_tier` | webhook destination + on/off, and which match tier triggers a push — `Strong — Pursue` (default) or `Decent — Consider` (also notify on Consider) |

### Section C — qa-learned rules (read-only)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `learned_exclusions` | qa-synthesized exclusion rules from your feedback |
| `learned_examples` | qa-synthesized example matches/mismatches |

These two are populated by `/fd-recycle-feedback`. If you want to clear or rewrite them manually, edit them like any other field below.

## Step 2 — Ask what to change

After showing current values, ask the user **one** open question: "Which field(s) do you want to change?" Don't list options exhaustively — they can read the table.

If they want to change something not in the Profile (e.g., reset everything, add a Favorite, change the Notion parent page), explain that this skill only edits Profile fields. For Favorites: tell them to add rows directly in the Favorites Notion DB. For re-setup: `/fd-setup --repair`.

## Step 3 — Apply changes

For each field the user wants to change, collect the new value via conversation. For multi-select fields (`work_modes`, `accepted_seniority`, `excluded_companies`, `excluded_industries`), confirm the full list they want, not a delta.

Apply all changes in **one** update call:

```bash
python3 -c "
from state.profile import update
update(
    field_name=value,
    another_field=value,
)
"
```

Substitute the actual field names + Python-literal values. For lists, use Python list literal: `work_modes=['Remote', 'Hybrid']`.

`state.profile.update` recomputes `profile_hash` automatically. You don't need to set it.

## Step 4 — Confirm

Display the fields that changed (`old → new`). Mention that `profile_hash` was recomputed — existing Tracker rows now read as profile-stale. New candidates pick up the change automatically on the next `/fd-run`; to re-score rows already in the Tracker against the new profile, run `/fd-rescore stale`.

## Notes for routine compatibility

This skill is **manual-only**. It's conversational, so it requires a human in the loop. Don't wire it into a Cloud Routine — there's no autonomous path here. (`/fd-run` and `/fd-recycle-feedback` are the routine-compatible commands.)
